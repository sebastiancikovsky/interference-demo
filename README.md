# Interference Detection and Anomaly Classification – Demonstration Repository

This repository provides a concise and fully reproducible demonstration of PCA-based interference detection and anomaly classification. It includes synthetic multichannel data and clean reference implementations that illustrate the core methodology discussed in the related research work. The repository contains the following components: `sample_data.csv` (synthetic dataset), `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies), `run_demo.py` (complete demonstration workflow), and the `src/` directory with `generate_data.py` (data generator), `pca_pipeline_demo.py` (PCA transformation and reconstruction error pipeline), and `anomaly_detection_demo.py` (threshold-based anomaly detection). To install dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To reproduce the demonstration, execute `python run_demo.py`, which loads the dataset, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, computes reconstruction errors, identifies anomalies, and prints evaluation metrics. The code can also be executed in Google Colab by running `!git clone https://github.com/sebastiancikovsky/interference-demo.git`, navigating into the repository, installing dependencies, and following the analysis steps shown in `run_demo.py`. All data and code necessary for reproducing the results are openly included, and no proprietary or sensitive datasets are used.
